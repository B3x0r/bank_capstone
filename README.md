# bank-capstone
This is a refactoring of Module 2 bank project that uses React, AWS, MongoDB, and Studio 3T. This is my final project in my MITxPRO Professional Certificate in Coding through Emeritus.

#### Installation:
 
You can check my Module 2 version here: https://rebecca-durst-banking-application.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html#/ Here's a video demo of the Module 2 website too: https://youtu.be/zCzoFa69X7c

Fork the project to your computer. Once you are in the Bank_Capstone file, use "node index.js" in the terminal. Then, you can navigate to localhost:3000
 
#### Usage:
 
You will be able to create an account and keep track account info. You will also be able to withdraw and deposit into "your account".
 
#### Support: 
 
I would just check the website version if you can't get a cloned version to work.
 
#### Roadmap: 
I'd like the website to adjust to the screen size.
